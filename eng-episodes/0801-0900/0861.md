Chapter 861 – Repaying Gratitude

"Xu Mu! The Xu Mu that slaughtered planets in the Western Domain!"

"This person was hunted by the Yao family and in the end forced the Yao family to retreat in defeat. The first person to survive the Heaven Order!"

"Rumors say that the Yao family suffered heavy losses and had many of their family members killed by Master Demon Xu Mu!"

"Not only this, but many cultivation families that participated in the hunt with the Yao family are now uneasy. As long as Xu Mu lives, they have to fear that Xu Mu will one day get revenge on them!"

Various talks exploded after a moment of silence. The name Xu Mu was too famous; almost no one in the Allheaven Star System didn't know the name!

As Shengong Hu stared dumbfoundedly at Wang Lin, the complex feeling in his heart gradually emerged. However, Wang Lin's early stage Nirvana Scryer cultivation shocked him greatly.

This shock came from the depths of his heart and filled his body. He really wasn't clear if the person before him was really as he thought.

Zhan Konglie was also startled. He didn't expect the familiar feeling he felt from the battle intent to be Wang Lin. Wang Lin's cultivation had thoroughly confused him.

"The first time I saw him, he was at the peak of the late stage of Ascendant. The second time, he was at Corporeal Yang. Now the third time… he has reached the early stage of Nirvana Scryer!! Was he really not hiding his cultivation…" Zhan Konglie was lost.

"Senior!" Beside Zhan Konglie, Zhan Yun immediately stood up in surprise. She quickly flew toward Wang Lin and respectfully stood dozens of feet away from him.

She wasn't the only one, there were others here who were saved by Wang Lin as well. They were very excited and flew toward and bowed toward him.

When he saw these people, Wang Lin nodded.

Just at this moment, a gloomy roar came from a white stone in the distance. On the white stone sat an old man, and beside him was Tang Yanfeng, who was knocked out!

"You, what qualifications do you have to ask for first place out of the 108 spots in the Southern Domain? You don't have the qualification token, and doing this is tantamount to ignoring all the cultivators in the Southern Domain!" The old man stared at Wang Lin with eyes filled with killing intent.

In his view, although this Xu Mu didn't kill Tang Yanfeng, he had still seriously injured Tang Yanfeng. Even if he recovered, his cultivation level would drop greatly. In his current state, there was no chance he could compete for the celestial title anymore.

Wang Lin's expression was cold as he looked at the old man.

Just at this moment, there was a middle-aged man about 1,000 feet from Wang Lin. He was one of the people Wang Lin had saved from the Thunder Celestial Realm. After silently pondering for a moment, he clenched his teeth, turned toward the Tang family elder, and said, "My Allheaven Star System Southern Domain Chen family recommends Senior Xu Mu to participate! I don't know if my Chen family has the qualifications!"

The eyes of the old man named Tang lit up. He didn't look at the middle-aged man but at the Chen family ancestor that came.

Then another cultivator stood up. This cultivator was old, and after he stood up, he looked at the old man named Tang. He said, "Allheaven Star System Southern Domain's Zhao family recommends Senior Xu Mu to participle. I wonder if my Zhao family is qualified in Senior Tang's eyes!"

"Allheaven Star System Southern Domain's Li family refers senior Xu Mu to join the battle. I don't know if my Li family has the qualifications!" A middle-aged man wearing dark blue took a step forward and looked at the old man named Tang.

"The Zheng family also recommends Senior Xu Mu. I wonder if my Zheng family has the qualifications!" After the middle-aged man, a woman wearing a colorful dress also stepped out. Although her voice was soft, it was firm.

"I'm a direct descent of the Miao family and I recommend Senior Xu Mu. My Miao family is one of the families on the three main planets. Senior Tang, does my Miao family have the qualifications?" A cold youth in black slowly walked out.

There four people were all saved by Wang Lin in the Thunder Celestial Temple. They were grateful toward Wang Lin, but due to their families, they were unable to help when Wang Lin was hunted by the Yao family. They had always felt guilty over it and right now they stood beside Wang Lin without any hesitation.

This scene caused the expression of the old man named Tang to change drastically. Even the Chen family ancestor was startled. He revealed a wry smile and decided to simply close his eyes.

Not only him, but all the leaders of the families that supported Wang Lin closed their eyes and were indifferent to this. Although this was the case, if anyone dared to question their families' qualifications, they would demand an explanation!

"Planet Earth Flame's Meng family recommends Senior Xu Mu. I don't know if my Meng family has the qualifications!" Another cultivator stepped forward and stared at the Tang family elder without any fear.

"Planet Thundercloud's Baili family recommends Senior Xu Mu…"

"Planet Dark Water's Si Kong family recommends Senior Xu Mu…"

"Planet Earth Flame's Zhou family recommends Senior Xu Mu…"

"Planet Sky Blue's Ning family also recommends Senior Xu Mu. I don't know if my Ning family as one of the families of the main planets has the qualifications!"

After those people stood up, even more people stood beside Wang Lin and stared at the Tang family elder. All of them were people who had managed to escape the Thunder Celestial Realm under Wang Lin's leadership!

The scene before him shocked the Tang family elder greatly. He looked at all the cultivators beside Wang Lin staring at his family's junior. Even though he was someone with a high cultivation level, he silently pondered.

These juniors were not worth anything, but the fact that the elders of their families did not stop them from doing this made the old man from the Tang family feel shock toward Xu Mu for the first time.

His was also at the Nirvana Scryer stage, and like Wang Lin, he was at the early stage of Nirvana Scryer. However, he had been at the Nirvana Scryer stage for a long time and had already reached the peak of early stage Nirvana Scryer.

In the Allheaven Star System, among the ordinary cultivation families, Yin and Yang stage cultivators could be considered a family's ancestors. Unless there were certain opportunities, it was impossible for Nirvana Scryer cultivators to appear.

Only the cultivation families on the main planets would have Nirvana Scryer cultivators, but there wouldn't be many. Just one per family was the limit.

Only a family like the Tang family, which was only one step below the Yao family, who had inheritance from the Celestial Realm, would have more than one second step cultivator! This came from tens of thousands of years of accumulation and couldn't be forced!

The old man was one of the four people in the Tang family at the second step! He was also the weakest one!

Zhan Konglie silently pondered for a while before raising his head and staring at the Tang family elder. "Zhan Konglie, representing the Zhan family, recommends Senior Xu Mu! Senior Tang do I, Zhan Konglie, not have the qualifications!?"

The old man's expression became even more gloomy.

"Shengong Hu recommends Senior Xu Mu with the qualifications to participate!" Shengong Hu didn't say much, but when he spoke, his eyes were filled with determination!

The Tang family elder began to sneer. Just as he was about to speak, a quiet voice came from the purple-robed elder from the Thunder Celestial Temple.

"Xu Mu has the qualifications!"

Once he said this, the Tang family elder's expression changed greatly. He knew the purple-robed elder's identity, so he didn't dare to refute. He let out a cold snort, waved his sleeves, and took Tang Yanfeng away.

The Tang family members quickly flew into the air, followed the old man, and left.

Before leaving, the Tang family elder mercilessly gazed at Wang Lin, his gaze revealed killing intent.

Wang Lin calmly looked over and said, "Explode!"

After he said that word, the Tang family elder was startled and his expression immediately changed. He turned around to look at Tang Yanfeng before Tang Yanfeng's body exploded into countless pieces!

Even his origin soul immediately shattered under this impact without giving the old man any chance to save him! Wang Lin had hidden a force inside Tang Yanfeng's body. Unless the old man's cultivation was one step above his, at the mid stage of Nirvana Scryer, then it would be impossible for him to find it in a short period of time.

Since the Tang family had killing intent toward him, Wang Lin didn't hesitate to detonate that force and cause Tang Yanfeng to completely perish!

"Your Tang family better not become the second Yao family!" Wang Lin's voice was calm, but the killing intent contained within was like a blast of cold wind.

"Xu Mu!" The old man from the Tang family was furious. There was a trace of sadness in his eyes as he stared fiercely at Wang Lin. With one step, he charged straight toward Wang Lin.

Wang Lin's expression remained neutral and he lifted his right hand. At this moment, a cold snort came from the purple-robed Thunder Celestial Temple messenger. The old man opened his eyes for the first time and revealed a cold gaze.

"No private battles are allowed during the competition. Tang Shan, take your Tang family members and scram for his old man! After the competition is over, if you want revenge, you can learn from the Yao family and resolve it yourself!"

The old man named Tang stopped. After silently pondering for a moment, he gave Wang Lin a vicious gaze before quickly leaving with the Tang family members.

The purple-robed old man from the Thunder Celestial Temple looked at Wang Lin. His eyes lit up and he calmly asked, "You want first place among the 108 spots in the Southern Domain?"

Wang Lin looked at the old man. Due to his current cultivation level, he could vaguely feel powerful origin energy fluctuations from the old man. Wang Lin wasn't able to see through this person's cultivation, but compared to Blood Ancestor, this old man was a lot weaker. If this old man wasn't at the Nirvana Cleanser stage, then he was at least at the late stage of Nirvana Scryer.

"I do!" Wang Lin calmly opened his mouth. His tone was decisive and was filled with battle intent.

The purple-robed old man's eyes revealed a trace of admiration as he slowly said, "Good. If no one here dares to challenge you, I'll give you first place in the Southern Domain qualification battle!

"Does anyone dare to challenge?" The purple-robed old man's eyes swept past the cultivators from the Southern Domain that were sitting on the red stones. Finally, his gaze landed on one person.

This person was dressed in black and looked about 40 years old. His face was slightly pale and there were nine blades stabbed into the ground before him!

Even when Wang Lin's battle intent arrived, he didn't react at all and silently cultivated. Only when Wang Lin revealed his early stage Nirvana Scryer cultivation did he raise his head and reveal an almost indistinguishable battle intent.

"Zhan Konglie challenges Senior Xu Mu!" An abrupt voice suddenly appeared. Zhan Konglie took a deep breath. His eyes were filled with confusion and a complex emotion. However, there was also battle intent as he respectfully clasped his hands at Wang Lin.

"If Senior can convince me, then I'll be willing to give you my dao ideal and name Senior my lord. Together, we will battle the Alliance!"

After he said those words, a huge wave was immediately set off within the area!
