# Book Reader Website: Tech Stack and Detailed Features

## 1) Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5 (`reader/index.html`)
- CSS3 (`reader/styles.css`)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6, `reader/app.js`)

### Content and Rendering
- Markdown chapter files (`eng-episodes/**/*.md`, `burmese-episodes/**/*.md`)
- `marked` (CDN) to parse Markdown into HTML
- `DOMPurify` (CDN) to sanitize rendered HTML before display

### Storage and Client State
- `localStorage` for:
  - Reader settings (theme, font, typography, filters)
  - Last opened chapter
  - Per-chapter scroll position
  - Bookmarks
  - Read status progress
- Browser Cache Storage API for offline chapter caching

### PWA / Offline
- Service Worker (`reader/sw.js`) for:
  - App shell caching
  - Markdown request caching
  - Offline fallback from cache
- Web App Manifest (`reader/app-manifest.json`) for installable app behavior

### Content Indexing / Tooling
- Python 3 script (`reader/generate_manifest.py`) to build `reader/manifest.json`
  - Scans `eng-episodes` and `burmese-episodes`
  - Extracts episode numbers
  - Sorts chapters and emits metadata
- PowerShell launcher (`reader/run_reader.ps1`)
  - Regenerates manifest
