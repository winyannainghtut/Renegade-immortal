# Chapter 1 - Wang Lin

Wang Lin was an ordinary young man living in a small village at the foot of the Heng Yue Mountain. His family was poor, but they were happy with their simple life.

The Celestial Realm had long been sealed, and the path of cultivation was fraught with danger. Yet, Wang Lin's heart burned with a desire to step onto the path of cultivation, to transcend mortality and understand the true meaning of the Dao.

On this day, the Heng Yue Sect was holding its once-in-a-decade disciple recruitment ceremony. Wang Lin, along with many other youths from surrounding villages, had come to try his luck.

"Next!" The voice of the sect elder echoed across the square.

Wang Lin took a deep breath and stepped forward. This was his chance to change his fate.

The testing stone glowed with a faint light. The sect elder raised an eyebrow, surprised.

"Five-element mixed roots, barely qualified," the elder announced. "You may join as an outer disciple."

Wang Lin's heart leaped with joy. Five-element mixed roots were considered trash talent in the cultivation world, but it was enough to enter the sect. He knew his journey would be ten thousand times harder than those with heavenly spiritual roots, but he was determined.

From this day forward, Wang Lin's life would never be the same. The path of the Renegade Immortal had begun.

## The Outer Sect

The outer sect of Heng Yue Sect was located at the foot of the mountain. Thousands of outer disciples lived here, all competing for limited resources and the attention of elders.

Wang Lin was assigned to a small room shared with three other disciples. His daily tasks included cleaning the sect grounds, tending to spirit herbs, and studying basic cultivation techniques.

At night, while others slept, Wang Lin cultivated alone under the moonlight. His progress was slow, but steady.

Three months passed. Wang Lin finally sensed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth—the first step of Qi Condensation!

Though he was only at the first layer, it was a beginning. Wang Lin's eyes shone with determination as he looked up at the stars.

"One day," he whispered, "I will stand at the peak of this world."

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
